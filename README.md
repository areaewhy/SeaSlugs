Website for dad!

The interesting part of this site is the audio player, which was written from scratch entirely with
pure JS. It's a mouthful, but I think it works pretty well!
Built to accept all information from the "playlist.js" file -- that's where the file src, title, desc are entered,
then player.js loads it in.

Written a couple months ago -- around Nov 2013, I think.
